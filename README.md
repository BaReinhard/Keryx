# Keryx

Named after KÄ“ryx (kay rooks), the service is an inviolatable messenger. This service provdes a standard way to interact with a chat platform. It allows for multiple platforms to be used at once or the ability to easily transition to a new platform without the end users having to change the way they interact with the service.

In more technical terminology it implements an abstraction over an adaptor pattern.
